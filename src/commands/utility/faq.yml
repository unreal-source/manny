    If your project was...
    • Saved in 4.0-4.26 → It will load in any engine version the same or newer
    • Saved in 4.27 → It will load in 4.27 or 5.0.0 or newer (but not 5.0EA)
    • Saved in 5.0EA → It will load in any version of UE5
    • Saved in 5.0.0 → It will load in 5.0.0 or newer (but not 5.0EA)
