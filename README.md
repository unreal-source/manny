## About
Manny is a friendly mannequin that informs and entertains our Discord community. He has a variety of handy commands that return useful info and resources, plus a few that are just for fun, such as generating a random game idea. He also manages our job board.

## Help us improve
If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/unreal-slackers/manny/issues) to see if someone already mentioned it. If you don't see it, [open a new issue](https://github.com/unreal-slackers/manny/issues/new/choose).

## Contributing

## Can I invite Manny to my server?
No. Manny is not hosted publicly or designed to work with multiple servers. The main reason the code is open source is to provide the Unreal Slackers community with an opportunity to see how the bot works and contribute directly if they’re interested.

Hosting your own copy of the bot is not supported. If you decide to adapt any of the code for your own purposes, please respect the [license](https://github.com/unreal-slackers/manny/blob/main/LICENSE).
